    "text": "\n \n April 23, 2025 6:00 AM \n \n \n \n Credit: VentureBeat made with Midjourney \n \n \n \n \n Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. Learn More \n \n Microsoft announced today a major expansion of its artificial intelligence tools with the “Microsoft 365 Copilot Wave 2 Spring release,” introducing new AI “ agents ” designed to function as digital colleagues that can perform complex workplace tasks through deep reasoning capabilities. \n In an exclusive interview, Aparna Chennapragada, Chief Product Officer of Experiences and Devices at Microsoft, told VentureBeat the company is building toward a vision where AI serves as more than just a tool — becoming an integral collaborator in daily work. \n “We are around the corner from a big moment in the AI world,” Chennapragada said. “It started out with all of the model advances, and everyone’s been really excited about it and the intelligence abundance. Now it’s about making sure that intelligence is available to all of the folks, especially at work.” \n The announcement accompanies Microsoft’s 2025 Work Trend Index, a comprehensive research report based on surveys of 31,000 workers across 31 countries, documenting the emergence of what Microsoft calls “Frontier Firms” — organizations restructuring around AI-powered intelligence and human-agent collaboration. \n Microsoft envisions a three-phase evolution of AI adoption, culminating in ‘human-led, agent-operated’ workplaces where employees direct AI systems. (Credit: Microsoft) \n How Microsoft’s new ‘Researcher’ and ‘Analyst’ agents bring deep reasoning to enterprise work \n At the center of Microsoft’s vision are two new AI agents named Researcher and Analyst, powered by OpenAI’s deep reasoning models. These agents are designed to handle complex research tasks and data analysis that previously required specialized human expertise. \n “Think of them as you know, like a really smart researcher and a data scientist in your pocket,” Chennapragada explained. She described how the Researcher agent recently helped her prepare for a business review by connecting information across various sources. \n “I was using it to say, hey, I have an important business review coming up… pull all the past meetings, past emails, figure out the CRM data, and then say, ‘Give me constructive, sharp inputs on how I should be able to push the ball forward for this meeting,'” she said. “Because of the deep reasoning, it actually made connections that I hadn’t thought of.” \n These agents will be available through a new “ Agent Store,” which will also feature agents from partners like Jira, Monday.com, and Miro, as well as custom agents built by organizations themselves. \n Workers face an interruption every two minutes and a dramatic surge in last-minute work, Microsoft data reveals, creating what the company calls a ‘capacity gap’. (Credit: Microsoft) \n Beyond chat: How Copilot is becoming the ‘browser for AI’ in Microsoft’s enterprise strategy \n Microsoft is positioning Copilot as a central organizing layer for AI interactions, similar to how web browsers organize internet content—not just a chatbot interface. \n “I look at Copilot as the browser for the AI world,” Chennapragada said. “In internet, we had websites, but we had the browser to organize the layer. For us, Copilot is this organizing layer, this browser for this AI world.” \n This vision extends beyond simple text interactions. The company is introducing Copilot Notebooks, which allows users to ground AI interactions in specific collections of files and meeting notes. A new Copilot Search feature provides AI-powered enterprise search capabilities across multiple applications. \n “Today, most of AI, we have equated it to chat,” Chennapragada noted. “Sometimes I feel like we’re in the DOS pre-GUI era, where you have this amazing intelligence, and you’re like, ‘oh, we have an AOL dial-up modem stuck on top of it.'” \n To address this limitation, Microsoft is bringing OpenAI’s GPT-4o AI image generation capabilities to business settings with a new Create feature, allowing employees to generate and modify brand-compliant images. \n With 80% of workers reporting insufficient time or energy, Microsoft sees AI agents as the solution to closing the productivity gap. (Credit: Microsoft) \n Employee burnout and workplace interruptions: The ‘capacity gap’ driving Microsoft’s AI focus \n Microsoft’s research reveals a significant “ Capacity Gap ” — 53% of leaders say productivity must increase, but 80% of the global workforce reports lacking the time or energy to do their work. The company’s telemetry data shows employees face 275 interruptions per day from meetings, emails, or messages—an interruption every two minutes during core work hours. \n “There’s so much more pent-up, latent demand for work and productivity and output,” Chennapragada said. “That statistic really stood out for me, that there’s so much more pent-up, latent demand for work and productivity and output. So I see this as an augmentation, less of a job displacement.” \n The research also indicates a shift in AI adoption patterns. While last year’s adoption was largely employee-led, this year shows a more top-down approach, with 81% of business decision makers saying they want to rethink core strategy and operations with AI. \n “That’s a shift between even last year, where it was much more bottom-up and employee-led,” Chennapragada noted. “What that tells us is there needs to be a much more of a top-down AI strategy, but also AI products that you roll out in the enterprise with security, with compliance, with all of the guardrails.” \n Leaders outpace employees on every measure of ‘agent boss mindset,’ with a 27-point gap in familiarity with AI agents, Microsoft’s research shows. (Credit: Microsoft) \n Rise of the ‘agent boss’: How Microsoft envisions employees managing digital workforces \n Microsoft predicts a fundamental restructuring of organizations around what it calls “Work Charts”—more fluid, outcome-driven team structures powered by agents that expand employee capabilities. \n This reorganization will require determining the optimal “human-agent ratio” for different functions, a metric that will vary by task and team. The company expects every employee to become an “agent boss”—someone who manages AI agents to amplify their impact. \n “For us at Microsoft, it’s not enough if 2% of our customers’ company adopts AI, it is really bringing the entire company along. That’s when you get the full productivity gains,” Chennapragada emphasized. \n The company’s research shows leaders are currently ahead of employees in embracing this mindset, with 67% of leaders familiar with agents compared to just 40% of employees. \n To help organizations navigate this transition, Microsoft is enhancing its Copilot Control System with new capabilities that allow IT administrators to manage agents across the organization. \n “What happens if you have all of these [agents] running around? Our customers have been asking for it,” Chennapragada said. “What we’ve built is a Copilot control system where IT admins can look and say, what’s the compliance, what’s the security, what’s the data privacy, what agents are in the system? How do I actually manage them?” \n Finding the optimal balance of human judgment and AI assistance will be critical, as too few or too many agents can diminish productivity. (Credit: Microsoft) \n Research shows ‘Frontier Firms’ leading AI adoption outperform competitors by wide margins \n The business implications extend beyond productivity gains. Microsoft’s research shows that 71% of workers at “Frontier Firms”—organizations at the leading edge of AI adoption—say their company is thriving, compared to just 37% globally. \n For small and medium businesses, the democratization of intelligence may level the playing field, allowing smaller teams to operate with capabilities once reserved for much larger organizations. \n While 33% of leaders are considering headcount reductions related to AI, 78% are also considering hiring for new AI-specific roles, including AI trainers, data specialists, security specialists, and AI agent specialists. \n LinkedIn data included in the research shows that the most prominent AI startups have grown headcount by 20.6% year-over-year—nearly twice the pace of Big Tech companies at 10.6%. \n “As incumbents adapt and challengers scale, like we saw in the dot-com boom, the rules of talent and competition are being rewritten in real time,” the company noted in its report. \n As Microsoft’s new AI tools roll out beginning in late May, the stage is set for what Chennapragada calls “the browser for the AI world.” Just as previous technological revolutions fundamentally changed how we work, the shift to human-agent teams promises to transform not just what work gets done—but who, or what, does it. \n \n \n Daily insights on business use cases with VB Daily \n If you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

    "text": "[Skip to main content](https://venturebeat.com/ai/emergence-ais-new-system-automatically-creates-ai-agents-rapidly-in-realtime-based-on-the-work-at-hand/#primary)\n\n_Join our daily and weekly newsletters for the latest updates and exclusive content on industry-leading AI coverage. [Learn More](https://venturebeat.com/newsletters/?utm_source=VBsite&utm_medium=desktopNav)_\n\n* * *\n\nAnother day, another announcement about AI agents.\n\nHailed by various market [research](https://venturebeat.com/security/gartner-2025-will-see-the-rise-of-ai-agents-and-other-top-trends/) [reports](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/superagency-in-the-workplace-empowering-people-to-unlock-ais-full-potential-at-work) as the big tech trend in 2025 — especially in the enterprise — it seems we can’t go more than 12 hours or so without the debut of another way to make, orchestrate (link together), or otherwise optimize purpose-built AI tools and workflows designed to handle routine white collar work.\n\nYet [Emergence AI](https://www.emergence.ai/), a startup founded by former IBM Research veterans and which [late last year debuted its own, cross-platform AI agent orchestration framework](https://venturebeat.com/ai/emergences-ai-orchestrator-launches-to-do-what-big-tech-offerings-cant-play-well-with-others/), is out with something novel from all the rest: an AI agent creation platform that lets the human user specify what work they are trying to accomplish via text prompts, and then turns it over to AI models to create the agents they believe are necessary to accomplish said work.\n\nThis new system is literally a no code, natural language, AI-powered multi-agent builder, and it works in real time. Emergence AI describes it as a milestone in recursive intelligence, aims to simplify and accelerate complex data workflows for enterprise users.\n\n“Recursive intelligence paves the path for agents to create agents,” said Satya Nitta, co-founder and CEO of Emergence AI. “Our systems allow creativity and intelligence to scale fluidly, without human bottlenecks, but always within human-defined boundaries.”\n\n![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hYJJiK3I.jpeg)Image of Dr. Satya Nitta, Co-founder and CEO of Emergence AI, during his keynote at the AI Engineer World’s Fair 2024, where he unveiled Emergence’s Orchestrator meta-agent and introduced the open-source web agent, Agent-E. (photo courtesy AI Engineer World’s Fair)\n\nThe platform is designed to evaluate incoming tasks, check its existing agent registry, and, if necessary, autonomously generate new agents tailored to fulfill specific enterprise needs. It can also proactively create agent variants to anticipate related tasks, broadening its problem-solving capabilities over time.\n\nAccording to Nitta, the orchestrator’s architecture enables entirely new levels of autonomy in enterprise automation. “Our orchestrator stitches multiple agents together autonomously to create multi-agent systems without human coding. If it doesn’t have an agent for a task, it will auto-generate one and even self-play to learn related tasks by creating new agents itself,” he explained.\n\nA brief demo shown to VentureBeat over a video call last week appeared duly impressive, with Nitta showing how a simple text instruction to have the AI categorize email sparked a wave of new agents being created, displayed on a visual timeline showing each agent represented as a colored dot in a column designating the category of work it was designed to help carry out.\n\n![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Animation.gif?w=800)Animated GIF image showing Emergence AI’s user interface for automatically creating multiple enterprise AI Agents.\n\nNitta also said the user could stop and intervene in this process, conveying additional text instructions, at any time.\n\n## Bringing agentic coding to enterprise workflows\n\nEmergence AI’s technology focuses on automating data-centric enterprise workflows such as ETL pipeline creation, data migration, transformation, and analysis. The platform’s agents are equipped with agentic loops, long-term memory, and self-improvement abilities through planning, verification, and self-play. This enables the system to not only complete individual tasks but also understand and navigate surrounding task spaces for adjacent use cases.\n\n“We’re in a weird time in the development of technology and our society. We now have AI joining meetings,” Nitta said. “But beyond that, one of the most exciting things that’s happened in AI over the last two, three years is that large language models are producing code. They’re getting better, but they’re probabilistic systems. The code might not always be perfect, and they don’t execute, verify, or correct it.”\n\nEmergence AI’s platform seeks to fill that gap by integrating large language models’ code-generation abilities with autonomous agent technology. “We’re marrying LLMs’ code generation capabilities with autonomous agent technology,” Nitta added. “Agentic coding has enormous implications and will be the story of the next year and the next several years. The disruption is profound.”\n\nEmergence AI highlights the platform’s ability to integrate with leading AI models such as [OpenAI’s GPT-4o](https://venturebeat.com/ai/insane-openai-introduces-gpt-4o-native-image-generation-and-its-already-wowing-users/) and [GPT-4.5](https://venturebeat.com/ai/openai-releases-gpt-4-5/), [Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet](https://venturebeat.com/ai/anthropics-stealth-enterprise-coup-how-claude-3-7-is-becoming-the-coding-agent-of-choice/), and [Meta’s Llama 3.3](https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-launches-open-source-llama-3-3-shrinking-powerful-bigger-model-into-smaller-size/), as well as frameworks like LangChain, Crew AI, and Microsoft Autogen.\n\nThe emphasis is on interoperability—allowing enterprises to bring their own models and third-party agents into the platform.\n\n## Expanding multi-agent capabilities\n\nWith the current release, the platform expands to include connector agents and data and text intelligence agents, allowing enterprises to build more complex systems without writing manual code.\n\nThe orchestrator’s ability to evaluate its own limitations and take action is central to Emergence’s approach.\n\n“A very non-trivial thing that’s happening is when a new task comes in, the orchestrator figures out if it can solve the task by checking the registry of existing agents,” Nitta said. “If it can’t, it creates a new agent and registers it.”\n\nHe added that this process is not simply reactive, but generative. “The orchestrator is not just creating agents; it’s creating goals for itself. It says, ‘I can’t solve this task, so I will create a goal to make a new agent.’ That’s what’s truly exciting.”\n\nBet lest you worry the orchestrator will spiral out of control and create _too_ many needless custom agents for each new task, Emergence’s research on its platform shows that it has been designed to — and successfully carries out — the additional requirement of winnowing down the number of agents created as it comes closer and closer to completing a task, adding agents with more general applicability to its internal registry for _your_ enterprise, and checking back with that before creating any new ones.\n\n![](https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DoLNMTAX.png)Graph showing the number of tasks increasing while the number of Emergence AI “core agents” and “multi agents” level off over time. Credit: Emergence AI\n\n## Prioritizing safety, verification, and human oversight\n\nTo maintain oversight and ensure responsible use, Emergence AI incorporates several safety and compliance features. These include guardrails and access controls, verification rubrics to evaluate agent performance, and human-in-the-loop oversight to validate key decisions.\n\nNitta emphasized that human oversight remains a key component of the platform. “A human in the loop is still important,” he said. “You need to verify that the multi-agent system or the new agents spawned are doing the task you want and went in the right direction.” The company has structured the platform with clear checkpoints and verification layers to ensure that enterprises retain control and visibility over automated processes.\n\nWhile pricing information has not been disclosed, Emergence AI invites enterprises to contact them directly for access and pricing details. Additionally, the company plans a further update in May 2025, which will extend the platform’s capabilities to support containerized deployment in any cloud environment and allow expanded agent creation through self-play.\n\n## Looking ahead: scaling enterprise automation\n\nEmergence AI is headquartered in New York, with offices in California, Spain, and India. The company’s leadership and engineering team include alumni from AI research labs and technology teams at IBM Research, Google Brain, The Allen Institute for AI, Amazon, and Meta.\n\nEmergence AI describes its work as still in the early stages but believes its recursive intelligence approach could unlock new possibilities for enterprise automation and, eventually, broader AI-driven systems.\n\n“We think agentic layers will always be necessary,” Nitta said. “Even as models get more powerful, generalization in the action space is incredibly hard. There’s plenty of room for people like us to advance this over the next decade.”\n\n**Daily insights on business use cases with VB Daily**\n\nIf you want to impress your boss, VB Daily has you covered.

    "text": "Every enterprise will soon rely on multi-agent systems – multiple AI agents working together – even when built on different frameworks or providers. Agents are intelligent systems that can act on your behalf using reasoning, planning, and memory capabilities. Under your supervision, they can think multiple steps ahead and accomplish tasks across various systems. \n Multi-agent systems rely on models with enhanced reasoning capabilities, like those available in Gemini 2.5. They also depend on integration with your workflows and connection to your enterprise data. Vertex AI – our comprehensive platform to orchestrate the three pillars of production AI: models, data, and agents – seamlessly brings these elements together. It uniquely combines an open approach with comprehensive platform capabilities to ensure agents perform reliably: a combination that would otherwise require fragmented and fragile solutions. \n Today, we're announcing multiple enhancements to Vertex AI so you can:  \n \n \n Build agents with an open approach and deploy them with enterprise-grade controls \n \n \n \n Agent Development Kit (ADK) is an open-source framework for designing agents built on the same framework that powers Google Agentspace and Google Customer Engagement Suite (CES) agents. Many powerful examples and extensible sample agents are readily available in Agent Garden. \n \n \n Agent Engine is a fully managed runtime in Vertex AI that helps you deploy your custom agents to production with built-in testing, release, and reliability at a global, secure scale.  \n \n \n \n Connect agents across your enterprise ecosystem \n \n \n \n Agent2Agent protocol gives your agents a common, open language to collaborate – no matter which framework or vendor they are built on. We are driving this open initiative, partnering with 50 + industry leaders (and growing) to advance our shared vision of multi-agent systems. \n \n \n Equip agents with your data using open standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) or connect directly with APIs and connectors managed in Google Cloud. You can ground your AI responses in Google Search, your preferred data sources, or with Google Maps data. \n \n \n Introducing Agent Development Kit and Agent Garden: Building agents with an open approach \n Agent Development Kit (ADK) is our new open-source framework that simplifies the process of building agents and sophisticated multi-agent systems while maintaining precise control over agent behavior. With ADK, you can build an AI agent in under 100 lines of intuitive code. Check out the examples here. \n Currently available in Python (more languages coming later in the year), you can: \n \n Shape how your agents think, reason, and collaborate through deterministic guardrails and orchestration controls, giving you precise control over agent behavior and decision-making processes.  \n Interact with your agents in human-like conversations with ADK's unique bidirectional audio and video streaming capabilities. With just a few lines of code, you can create natural interactions that change how you work with agents – moving beyond text into rich, interactive dialogue. Check out the demo of an interactive agent from the opening keynote at NEXT 2025 built on the ADK here. \n Jumpstart your development with Agent Garden, a collection of ready-to-use samples and tools directly accessible within ADK. Leverage pre-built agent patterns and components to accelerate your development process and learn from working examples. \n Choose the model that works best for your needs. ADK works with your model of choice – whether it is Gemini or your any model accessible via Model Garden. Beyond Google’s models, you can choose across 200+ models from providers like Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, AI21 Labs, CAMB.AI, Qodo, and more.  \n Select your deployment target, be it local debugging or any containerized production deployment, such as Cloud Run, Kubernetes, or Vertex AI. ADK also supports Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling secure connections between your data and agents. \n Deploy to production using the direct integration to Vertex AI. This clear, reliable path from development to enterprise-grade deployment removes the typical overhead associated with moving agents to production. \n \n While ADK works with your preferred tools, it’s optimized for Gemini and Vertex AI. For example, AI agents built with ADK using Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental can break down complex problems through Gemini’s enhanced reasoning capabilities, and work with your preferred systems through its tool use capabilities. You can also deploy this agent to a fully-managed runtime and operate it at enterprise scale, using the native integration to Vertex AI from ADK. ADK framework showing how you can build multi-agent systems Hear how our customers are already using ADK: \n “Using Agent Development Kit, Revionics is building a multi-agent system to help retailers set prices based on their business logic — such as staying competitive while maintaining margins — and accurately forecasting the impact of price changes. ADK streamlines multi-agent transfer and planning, such as knowing when to transfer between specialized agents (data retrieval) and tools (constraint application), thereby combining Revionics’ pricing AI with agentic AI to automate entire pricing workflows. Data is central to Revionics’ process, and the development kit enables agents to efficiently reason over big data through storage artifacts rather than relying solely on the LLM context.” – Aakriti Bhargava, VP of Product Engineering and AI at Revionics. \n \"We used the ADK to develop an agent that ensures we're installing EV chargers where drivers need them most. The agent assists our data analysts to leverage geographical, zoning, and traffic data to inform and prioritize critical EV infrastructure investments that maximize driver convenience with less strain on our teams.\" – Laurent Giraud, Chief Data (&amp;AI) Officer, Renault Group.  \n “We've implemented the Agent Engine as the backbone of our video analysis AI agent, powered by Gemini. This setup allows us to leverage the Python Vertex AI SDK without worrying about infrastructure, saving us an estimated month of development time. Plus, the Agent Engine's API seamlessly connects with other Google Cloud products like Workflows, giving us excellent maintainability and room to grow.” – Rina Tsuji, Senior Manager, Corporate Strategy, Nippon Television Holdings, Inc. \n Introducing Agent Engine: Deploying AI agents with enterprise-grade controls \n Agent Engine is our fully managed runtime that makes it easy to deploy AI agents to production. No more rebuilding your agent system when moving from prototype to production. Agent Engine handles agent context, infrastructure management, scaling complexities, security, evaluation, and monitoring. Agent Engine also integrates with ADK (or your preferred framework) for a frictionless develop-to-deploy experience. Together, you can: \n \n Deploy agents built using any framework – whether you're using ADK, LangGraph, Crew.ai, or others, and regardless of your chosen model (Gemini, Anthropic’s Claude, Mistral AI, or others). This flexibility is paired with enterprise-grade controls for governance and compliance. \n Keep the context in your sessions: Rather than starting from a blank slate each time, the Agent Engine supports short-term memory and long-term memory. This way, you can manage your sessions and your agents can recall your past conversations and preferences. \n Measure and improve agent quality with comprehensive evaluation tools from Vertex AI. Improve agent performance by using the Example Store or fine-tune models to refine your agents based on real-world usage. \n Drive broader adoption by connecting to Agentspace: You can register your agents hosted on Agent Engine to Google Agentspace. This enterprise platform puts Gemini, Google-quality search, and powerful agents in the hands of employees while maintaining centralized governance and security. \n \n Here’s how it all comes together: Agent Engine connects across your enterprise for multi-agent systems In the coming months, we will further expand Agent Engine capabilities with advanced tooling and testing. Your agents will have computer-use capabilities and will be able to execute code. Additionally, a dedicated simulation environment will let you rigorously test agents with diverse user personas and realistic tools to ensure reliability in production. \n Introducing Agent2Agent protocol: Connecting agents across your enterprise ecosystem \n One of the biggest challenges in enterprise AI adoption is getting agents built on different frameworks and vendors to work together. That’s why we partnered with many industry leaders who share our vision of multi-agent systems to create an open Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol.  \n Agent2Agent protocol enables agents across different ecosystems to communicate with each other, irrespective of the framework (ADK, LangGraph, Crew.ai, or others) or vendor they are built on. Using A2A, agents can publish their capabilities and negotiate how they will interact with users (via text, forms, or bidirectional audio/video) – all while working securely together.  \n As of today, 50+ partners such as Box, Deloitte, Elastic, PayPal, Salesforce, ServiceNow, UiPath, UKG, Weights &amp; Biases, and many more are committed to working with us on the protocol. For details on the partners using the protocol, please refer to the blog here. Defining interoperability together with our partners Beyond working with other agents, your agents also need access to your enterprise truth – the ecosystem of information you have built across data sources, APIs, and business capabilities. You can equip agents with your existing enterprise truth data without building from scratch, using any approach you prefer:  \n \n \n ADK supports Model Context Protocol (MCP), so your agents connect to the vast and diverse data sources or capabilities you already rely on by leveraging the growing ecosystem of MCP-compatible tools. \n \n \n From ADK, you can also connect your agents directly to your enterprise systems and capabilities. This includes 100+ pre-built connectors, workflows built with Application Integration, or data stored within your systems like AlloyDB, BigQuery, NetApp and much more. For example, you can build AI agents directly on your existing NetApp data, no data duplication required. \n \n \n Using ADK, you can also seamlessly connect to your existing agents built in other frameworks like LangGraph or call tools from diverse sources including MCP, LangChain, CrewAI, Application Integration, and any OpenAPI endpoints. \n \n \n In Apigee API management, we manage over 800K APIs that power your business, within and beyond Google Cloud. Using ADK, your agents can also tap into these existing API investments – no matter where they reside – with proper permissions. \n \n \n Once connected, you can ground your AI responses with information like Google Search or specialized data from providers like Cotality, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, HGInsights, S&amp;P Global, and Zoominfo. For agents that rely on geospatial context, today we’re making it possible to ground your agents with Google Maps 1. We make 100 million updates to Maps data every day, ensuring it is fresh and factual. And now, using Grounding with Google Maps, your agents can provide responses with geospatial information tied to millions of places in the U.S.  \n Enterprise grade security for your AI agents: Building agents your enterprise can trust \n Beyond functionality, enterprise AI agents operating in production face security concerns like prompt injection attacks, unauthorized data access, and generating inappropriate content. Building with Gemini and Vertex AI in Google Cloud addresses these challenges in multiple layers. You can:  \n \n \n Control agent output using Gemini's built-in safety features including configurable content filters and system instructions that define boundaries around prohibited topics and align with your brand voice. \n \n \n Manage agent permissions through identity controls that let you determine whether agents operate with dedicated service accounts or on behalf of individual users, preventing privilege escalation and unauthorized access. \n \n \n Protect sensitive data by confining agent activity within secure perimeters using Google Cloud's VPC service controls, preventing data exfiltration and limiting potential impact radius. \n \n \n Establish guardrails around your agents to control interactions at every step – from screening inputs before they reach models to validating parameters before tool execution.

    "text": "\n China’s tech companies will drive adoption of the MCP (Model Context Protocol) standard that transforms AI assistants from simple chatbots into powerful digital helpers. \n MCP works like a universal connector that lets AI assistants interact directly with favourite apps and services – enabling them to make payments, book appointments, check maps, and access information on different platforms on users’ behalves. \n As reported by the South China Morning Post, companies like Ant Group, Alibaba Cloud, and Baidu are deploying MCP-based services and positioning AI agents as the next step, after chatbots and large language models. But will China’s MCP adoption truly transform the AI landscape, or is it simply another step in the technology’s evolution? \n Why China’s MCP adoption matters for AI’s evolution \n The Model Context Protocol was initially introduced by Anthropic in November 2024, at the time described as a standard that connects AI agents “to the systems where data lives, including content repositories, business tools and development environments.” \n MCP serves as what Ant Group calls a “USB-C port for AI applications” – a universal connector allowing AI agents to integrate with multiple systems. \n The standardisation is particularly significant for AI agents like Butterfly Effect’s Manus, which are designed to autonomously perform tasks by creating plans consisting of specific subtasks using available resources. \n Unlike traditional chatbots that just respond to queries, AI agents can actively interact with different systems, collect feedback, and incorporate that feedback into new actions. \n Chinese tech giants lead the MCP movement \n China’s MCP adoption by tech leaders highlights the importance placed on AI agents as the next evolution in artificial intelligence: \n \n Ant Group, Alibaba’s fintech affiliate, has unveiled its “MCP server for payment services,” that lets AI agents connect with Alipay’s payment platform. The integration allows users to “easily make payments, check payment statuses and initiate refunds using simple natural language commands,” according to Ant Group’s statement. \n Additionally, Ant Group’s AI agent development platform, Tbox, now supports deployment of more than 30 MCP services currently on the market, including those for Alipay, Amap Maps, Google MCP, and Amazon Web Services’ knowledge base retrieval server. \n Alibaba Cloud launched an MCP marketplace through its AI model hosting platform ModelScope, offering more than 1,000 services connecting to mapping tools, office collaboration platforms, online storage services, and various Google services. \n Baidu, China’s leading search and AI company, has indicated that its support for MCP would foster “abundant use cases for [AI] applications and solutions.” \n \n Beyond chatbots: Why AI agents represent the next frontier \n China’s MCP adoption signals a shift in focus from large language models and chatbots to more capable AI agents. As Red Xiao Hong, founder and CEO of Butterfly Effect, described, an AI agent is “more like a human being” compared to how chatbots perform. \n The agents not only respond to questions but “interact with the environment, collect feedback and use the feedback as a new prompt.” This distinction is held to be important by companies driving progress in AI. \n While chatbots and LLMs can generate text and respond to queries, AI agents can take actions on multiple platforms and services. They represent an advance from the limited capabilities of conventional AI applications toward autonomous systems capable of completing more complex tasks with less human intervention. \n The rapid embrace of MCP by Chinese tech companies suggests they view AI agents as a new avenue for innovation and commercial opportunity that go beyond what’s possible with existing chatbots and language models. \n China’s MCP adoption could position its tech companies at the forefront of practical AI implementation. By creating standardised ways for AI agents to interact with services, Chinese companies are building ecosystems where AI could deliver more comprehensive experiences. \n Challenges and considerations of China’s MCP adoption \n Despite the developments in China’s MCP adoption, several factors may influence the standard’s longer-term impact: \n \n International standards competition. While Chinese tech companies are racing to implement MCP, its global success depends on widespread adoption. Originally developed by Anthropic, the protocol faces potential competition from alternative standards that might emerge from other major AI players like OpenAI, Google, or Microsoft. \n Regulatory environments. As AI agents gain more autonomy in performing tasks, especially those involving payments and sensitive user data, regulatory scrutiny will inevitably increase. China’s regulatory landscape for AI is still evolving, and how authorities respond to these advancements will significantly impact MCP’s trajectory. \n Security and privacy. The integration of AI agents with multiple systems via MCP creates new potential vulnerabilities. Ensuring robust security measures across all connected platforms will be important for maintaining user trust. \n Technical integration challenges. While the concept of universal connectivity is appealing, achieving integration across diverse systems with varying architectures, data structures, and security protocols presents significant technical challenges. \n \n The outlook for China’s AI ecosystem \n China’s MCP adoption represents a strategic bet on AI agents as the next evolution in artificial intelligence. If successful, it could accelerate the practical implementation of AI in everyday applications, potentially transforming how users interact with digital services. \n As Red Xiao Hong noted, AI agents are designed to interact with their environment in ways that more closely resemble human behaviour than traditional AI applications. The capacity for interaction and adaptation could be what finally bridges the gap between narrow AI tools and the more generalised assistants that tech companies have long promised. \n See also: Manus AI agent: breakthrough in China’s agentic AI \n \n Want to learn more about AI and big data from industry leaders?

    "text": "\n \n By Jacques Bughin and Philipp Remy \n Agentic AI is a new class of AI systems that combine goal-driven autonomy and represents the third wave of AI, moving beyond prediction and generation to execution. While early use cases already show value generation in many sectors, challenges concerning its reliability, governance and accuracy remain. Enterprise adoption is on the rise, but the way forward requires careful design, clear use cases and human oversight (humans in the loop). Business leaders must act with realism and urgency, preparing systems, teams and strategies for AI-powered collaboration. \n 1. Introduction \n Agentic AI refers to intelligent systems capable of pursuing goals through multi-step reasoning, dynamic decision-making and the use of tools. Unlike earlier forms of AI that required constant human intervention, these agents operate semi-autonomously or fully autonomously, relying on APIs and web interfaces to take real action on behalf of users and workers. \n Agentic AI uses large language models as its core reasoning engine, but wraps them in agents capable of planning, acting, using tools, remembering context and learning from results. The result is not just increased automation, it’s a new paradigm: an intelligent digital workforce that executes, adapts and collaborates in ways hitherto reserved for humans. \n As the next frontier of AI-enabled enterprise, the key question is no longer what’s possible, but what works, and how quickly it will become the norm.” \n 2. Five Unknowns…to Know \n Fact 1: Agentic AI is the third wave of AI \n Much confusion still surrounds the notion of agentic AI (AAI). A useful way to understand it is to examine its relationship with previous waves of AI. \n Predictive AI (PAI) – the first wave – focused on automating routine tasks such as forecasting, classification and pattern detection from structured or semi-structured data. Think remote sensing, machine translation and speech recognition. \n Generative AI (GAI) – the second wave exempted by Open AI – introduced the ability to create new outputs such as text, images or code. It revolutionized content generation, but remained dependent on user prompts and limited to its learning data. \n Agentic AIs don’t just assist human action; they enhance it by taking on tasks that require high involvement and multi-tasking without constant human intervention. \n Today, agentic AI (AAI) – the third wave – goes a step further. It is based on large language models (LLMs), but extends their use by integrating them into autonomous agents that reason, act and adapt. These systems can make decisions, perform tasks and learn continuously, giving them added value beyond ad hoc content generation. Thus, one of the factors driving the design of agentic AIs is the need for tools designed to operate in better but complex real-world conditions, with plenty of room for maneuver. Agentic AIs don’t just assist human action; they enhance it by taking on tasks that require high involvement and multi-tasking without constant human intervention. \n Fact 2: Agent AI – the tip of the iceberg \n Agentic AI has long been the stuff of dreams – like the first generation of AI that relies on the cloud and machine learning algorithms, agentic AI is not a “breakthrough ex nihilo”, but rather the result of six enabling forces. \n LLM models such as GPT-4, Claude 3, Mistral and others can now reason, understand and adapt to all domains, representing a significant advance over fragile rule-based systems. Secondly, we now have a scalable computing infrastructure with access to AI-optimized GPUs (NVIDIA H100s), edge computing and containerized deployment frameworks that enable the use of high-performance real-time agents. Thirdly, open-source frameworks such as LangChain and commercial SaaS APIs enable agents to interact with software as actors rather than observers. \n And with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), vector stores and windows of over 100,000 tokens, agents can reflect, learn and remember over time. Finally, natural language interfaces offer code-free delegation and interfaces that can be easily used by end-users and non-technical teams alike. \n Fact 3: Combining six unique capabilities \n If agentic AI is the result of a set of converging technical forces, agentic AI has a set of capabilities that totally differentiate it from previous AI approaches \n One of the hallmarks of agentic AI is autonomy; whereas generative systems wait for instructions, agentic agents can operate independently once given a goal. For example, Adept’s ACT-1 system allows users to enter high-level instructions such as “Plan sales meeting and prepare presentation”, and the agent autonomously takes care of the details: checking calendars, creating slides and sending invitations, all without additional intervention. This is in stark contrast to traditional tools, which require users to orchestrate each step manually. \n Agentic AI is also proactive. Unlike generative systems that respond to prompts without awareness of broader goals, agentic agents pursue objectives. They initiate tasks, monitor progress and correct course if necessary. Shopify’s Sidekick, for example, can take into account a merchant’s overall goal – such as “increase my store’s conversion rate” – and proactively suggest price changes, rewrite product descriptions and launch A/B tests. In the consumer field, Amazon’s Returns Assistant demonstrates similar capabilities by accessing a customer’s order history, determining the eligibility of a return and proposing personalized solutions in real time, all without human escalation. \n Crucially, agentic systems make complex decisions. They evaluate trade-offs, prioritize actions and adapt according to the results. In sales and marketing, platforms like Relevance AI deploy agents that don’t just send emails, but actively generate and test lead generation strategies by combining data on ideal customer profiles, historical campaign performance and channel effectiveness. Similarly, Composer – formerly MindStudio – uses agents that orchestrate multi-channel campaigns, optimize budget allocations and iterate on messages to boost performance, making real-time decisions at every stage. \n Learning and adaptation are another characteristic feature. While generative AI can improve through retraining, agentic systems are designed to constantly evolve from their own experiences. \n Learning and adaptation are another characteristic feature. While generative AI can improve through retraining, agentic systems are designed to constantly evolve from their own experiences. Spotter.ai, for example, improves its interactions with customer support over time by learning from feedback and results. The agent aligns itself more closely with a brand’s tone, escalates fewer tickets and anticipates customer needs based on previous cases. Cognosys goes a step further by enabling agents to “learn” an organization’s internal documentation and tools, then autonomously integrate new employees by generating guides and answering domain-specific questions without starting from scratch every time. \n Tool integration is another key capability. Agentic AI is not limited to conversation or content generation – it acts in the real world. Thanks to APIs, databases, form submissions and software interfaces, agents can perform end-to-end workflows. AutoGPT and Superagent, for example, can be connected to platforms such as CRMs, messaging services and payment processors to perform real-world business processes such as greeting customers, updating records, sending invoices and tracking transactions – autonomously and on a massive scale. This autonomy is not limited to single-step actions. Agentic systems reason and plan in several stages, adapting as they get closer to a goal. Let’s take the example of an agent built with LangChain, which is asked to analyze the prices charged by competitors. He might start by researching websites, then compare prices with internal margins, recommend markdowns, and finally draft an internal memo for the sales team. Each of these steps depends on the results of the previous one, requiring continuous reasoning and adjustment. \n Memory is another cornerstone. Agentic agents retain knowledge of previous interactions, user preferences and the relevant organizational context. This enables them to deliver consistent, context-sensitive performance over time. Tools such as personal AI store and recall information about how a person writes, thinks and communicates, which \n It is the combination of these capabilities that makes agentic AI an active collaborator in business processes; autonomy and multi-stage planning enable agents to take on entire tasks (such as qualifying potential customers or reprogramming logistics) that would otherwise require many hours of human labor. Proactivity and complex reasoning enable agents not only to respond to problems, but also to predict and optimize them (avoiding lost sales or supply disruptions). Continuous learning ensures that these agents don’t stagnate – a marketing agent gets smarter with each campaign, a supply chain agent adapts to new market data – delivering cumulative returns over time. Tool integration enables agents to execute decisions directly within enterprise systems, reducing the time between understanding and action. Memory gives agents the rich context needed for personalization and consistency, turning interactions into relationships (customers feel that AI “knows” them, employees find that AI remembers corporate knowledge). Last but not least, human supervision closes the loop by providing the governance that allows all stakeholders to feel comfortable deploying these powerful autonomous systems in mission-critical operations. \n Fact 4: Agentic AI is still in its infancy, but is already delivering value. \n There are already a large number of use cases for agentic AI technologies in various sectors, from healthcare to industry. In healthcare, an agentic AI-based monitoring system developed for healthcare monitoring can independently identify deterioration in a patient’s condition through regular monitoring of vital signs. In Germany, MediTech AI’s diagnostic system actively highlights areas of concern and suggests diagnoses, resulting in a 30% improvement in diagnostic accuracy and a 50% reduction in diagnosis time \n In the financial sector, WorldQuant exploits agentic AI, and more specifically reinforcement learning, to create trading algorithms capable of adapting in real time to changing market conditions. These algorithms analyze large amounts of financial data, identify patterns and execute trades autonomously. AI is designed to continuously learn from its successes and failures, adjusting its strategies to optimize performance. A key element is that AI identifies and exploits market inefficiencies, rather than simply reacting to pre-programmed rules. It works like an agent making decisions. \n In sales, Salesforce’s Agentforce 2.0 has introduced agent skills such as sales development and sales coaching, as well as lead development and personal buying. The sales coaching agent, for example, uses AI and CRM data to analyze sales pitches and role-play sessions, providing personalized feedback to help sales reps close deals more effectively. Other AI agents help with marketing campaigns, merchant management and service planning. These additions enable companies to nurture leads, participate in prospecting calls, provide feedback and tailor skills to various use cases, including field service work. Skills can be customized to meet specific business needs \n In the field of enterprise automation, players such as UiPath have deployed AI-powered process agents that manage workflows in finance, procurement and IT In a factory, agentic AI calculates the expected time to machine failure and remaining useful life, as well as when to perform maintenance activities to maximize operational availability. This system exploits data from a cluster of machines to proactively predict future breakdowns and optimize resource distribution, which in turn boosts production as part of the company’s automation. \n In the contact center sector, Cresta AI has implemented AI coaching agents that operate in real time, suggesting optimal responses, highlighting best next actions and automatically evaluating call quality. Fortune 500 customers using Cresta have reported a 25-30% reduction in handling time and a 20% increase in conversion rates. The AI-based QA system now replaces over 80% of manual QA work. Another example is cable media company Comcast, which has implemented a search-augmented AI agent called AMA (“Ask Me Anything”) to support its customer service teams. The agent provides real-time answers to questions posed by agents during customer calls, reducing the average handling time of support conversations involving complex issues by more than 10%. The company also reported millions of dollars in annual savings and over 80% positive feedback from human agents using the system. \n In the field of human resources and recruitment, Paradox’s “Olivia” agent automates high-volume recruitment for companies such as McDonald’s and Unilever. The agent selects candidates, schedules interviews and answers applicants’ questions. Case studies show that Olivia reduces the time spent by the recruiter on each candidate by over 90%, and cuts the time to hire by a factor of four, while maintaining a candidate satisfaction rate of over 95%. \n Agentic cybersecurity systems such as Exaforce, Legion or Aptori are also built to make human experts more efficient by automating certain aspects of their work. They can detect attacks autonomously and produce reports, improving system security and reducing the workload of human experts by up to 90%. 36 Agentic AI can also help software development teams detect vulnerabilities in new code. It can run tests and communicate directly with developers to explain how to proceed. It can run tests and communicate directly with developers to explain how to solve a problem – something that human engineers have to do manually today. 37 \n Fact 5: Rome wasn’t built in a day. \n These case studies highlight one constant: agentic AI is not a fad, and can deliver operational benefits. But behind the scenes, AI agents need to work with great precision to go mainstream. \n With regard to the above cases, we can deduce that agentic AI works (read: requires) well for defined task domains, clean structured data and tool integration. Otherwise, the benefits of agentic AI can only be speculative. \n If we look closely at the experience of AI agents today, we have to admit that success rates for agentic AI are still low. Even the most successful AI agents achieve success rates as low as 24% in benchmarks involving realistic tasks such as those encountered in software engineering roles. Tasks requiring long-term planning or multi-stage execution amplify failure rates due to cumulative errors. The most successful models (e.g. Claude 3.5 Sonnet) are also the most expensive, while cheaper models such as GPT-4o achieve significantly lower success rates and require more steps to solve tasks, which is a strong indication of residual inefficiency. \n Agents that rely on multiple API calls or attempt long chains of action can become slow or inconsistent, degrading the user experience. \n On the other hand, agentic AI remains fragile. One of the most common problems of generic AI is hallucination, i.e. the model’s tendency to invent information when confronted with ambiguity. In agentic systems, hallucination becomes more dangerous because it can lead to actions, not just words. For example, an agent who misinterprets a vague instruction may cancel a customer’s account instead of pausing it. Worse still, AI agents seem to continue to struggle against adverse inputs, hallucinations and cascading failures in high-risk use cases such as medical data processing or financial transactions. Another failure mode is over-autonomy. When agents are allowed to chain tool calls or operate on multiple systems without supervision, unforeseen results become more likely. Companies deploying these systems therefore need to put in place strong safeguards: action constraints, pre-approved APIs, audit logs and optional human intervention steps in the loop. \n Latency and complexity also pose problems. Agents that rely on multiple API calls or attempt long chains of action can become slow or inconsistent, degrading the user experience. Many vendors are now implementing optimization layers that prioritize speed and reliability, while others use fallback flows or escalations to avoid critical failures. \n Finally, failures often occur during handovers between humans and agents, or when agents have to clarify ambiguous instructions. \n The fragility of artificial intelligence agents has several consequences today. While AI agents can handle routine tasks, they are far from ready for high-stakes or unsupervised applications. Today’s applications must also continue to rely heavily on “agentic workflows”, where AI agents operate semi-autonomously, but under close human supervision. Companies need to carefully assess where and how to deploy these systems to avoid costly mistakes. \n Finally, multi-agent systems – where several AI agents collaborate seamlessly – are the new mantra of agentic AI, but they may remain largely experimental as they tend to multiply errors rather than solve them.   \n 3. Preparing for the Agentic AI Wave \n So agentic AI works, but remains narrow, with human supervision in the loop. The way ahead is, like any new technological advance, somewhat uncertain, but some conjecture suggests that the future may develop more rapidly than previously thought. \n Technology improvement curves accelerate \n The first is that the technological evolution of AI agents could follow a rapid trajectory, similar to that of other transformative technologies such as autonomous cars and generative AI. \n Self-driving cars faced similar early challenges: high costs, limited reliability in complex environments and regulatory hurdles. Over time, improvements in sensor technology, machine learning models and safety protocols have made autonomous vehicles more viable, even if they are not yet fully autonomous. \n On the other hand, generative AI has seen rapid progress since its inception, In benchmark tests such as GLUE and MMLU, for example, GPT-3 scored 43.9% on MMLU in 2020, while Gemini 1.0 Ultra surpassed human performance with a 90% score in December 2023 – a doubling of accuracy in the space of three years. However, generative AI also shows performance degradation when applied outside its scope, a problem reflected in AI agents. \n Agentic AI also builds on the foundations of LLMs, leveraging their capabilities for autonomous decision-making, contextual understanding and continuous learning. For example, agentic AI systems use frameworks such as LangChain and LlamaIndex to connect LLMs to external tools and databases, enabling real-time data access and memory retention. This integration accelerates their ability to manage complex tasks autonomously. The research also shows that by refining LLMs for specific applications (e.g., marketing automation or supply chain management), agentic AI systems can rapidly achieve greater accuracy and efficiency in specialized tasks. \n Based on the above, the most likely scenario is perhaps faster than the physical world of intelligent vehicles, and probably slightly faster than the pace of the improvement curve observed in LLMS. However, this tells us that in the not too distant future (3 years or so), we can expect significant advances in reliability, cost-effectiveness and probably the fusion of strong multi-agent collaboration capabilities. \n Message to executives \n Agentic AI represents a promising, albeit still evolving, technology class with a likely transformative impact on the horizon of the current strategic plan. For business leaders, the opportunity lies in experimenting with lucid realism – piloting where the value is clearest, developing organizational readiness and laying the foundations for responsible scale. We live in an age where pace and precision are important. \n The general manager should therefore consider the following as soon as possible: \n \n Think about how agentic AI can change the way your organization creates and delivers value. \n Start exploring areas where semi-autonomous agents can generate incremental productivity gains, particularly in high-volume, repetitive workflows. \n Start identifying areas where workflows could be restructured to support the increase in AI. Align IT and operational teams with evolving system requirements \n Set up internal AI governance, clean data orchestration and workforce capacity in the loop. \n Develop and prepare a vision of how your organization will work with the gloves of AI and the impact this will have on your HR strategy. \n \n About the Authors \n Jacques Bughin is the CEO of MachaonAdvisory and a former professor of Management.

    "summary": "Agentic AI, representing the third wave of AI, advances beyond predictive and generative capabilities by incorporating goal-driven autonomy, enabling systems to reason, act, and adapt autonomously. This new class of AI systems utilizes large language models (LLMs) wrapped in agents capable of planning and dynamic decision-making, enhancing human action by performing complex tasks without constant supervision. Despite its promising applications across sectors such as healthcare, finance, sales, and human resources, challenges remain in ensuring these systems' reliability, governance, and accuracy, particularly concerning issues like \"hallucination\" and over-autonomy.

    "text": "**Introduction**\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) agents are revolutionizing automation by handling complex workflows autonomously. However, as AI agents grow in complexity and usage, developers face challenges in deployment, scalability, and resource management. This is where Docker plays a crucial role. By containerizing AI agents, developers can ensure consistency, portability, and scalability across various environments.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll explore how to deploy and scale AI agents using Docker, Docker Compose, and orchestration tools like Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. We'll also include real-world case studies of AI agent deployments in containerized environments, focusing on their real-world impact and ways Docker can enhance AI workloads.\n\n[![Illustration of AI Agents in Docker](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fh2ij0ra7i6tatlihlehy.png)](https://media2.dev.to/dynamic/image/width=800%2Cheight=%2Cfit=scale-down%2Cgravity=auto%2Cformat=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fuploads%2Farticles%2Fh2ij0ra7i6tatlihlehy.png)\n\n**Why AI Agents Need Docker**\n\nDeploying AI agents without containerization can lead to dependency conflicts, environment inconsistencies, and scalability limitations. Docker helps overcome these issues through:\n\n- Portability – Run AI agents across different machines without setup issues.\n- Isolation – Keep dependencies separate and prevent conflicts. Scalability – Spin up multiple AI agents effortlessly.\n- Resource Efficiency – Optimize CPU and memory usage for high-performance AI workloads.\n\nBy using Docker, we can encapsulate AI models, APIs, and dependencies into lightweight containers, making AI agents more reliable and scalable.\n\nAdditionally, Docker can enhance AI workloads by integrating GPU support, optimizing AI-specific performance, and creating a dedicated AI Agents category on Docker Hub.\n\n**_Real-World Case Study: AI Agents in Financial Services_**\n\n**Use Case: Automated Trading Bots**\n\nA leading fintech company wanted to deploy multiple AI-powered trading bots that could analyze market trends in real time and execute trades. Challenges included:\n\n- Ensuring low latency in decision-making.\n- Scaling agents dynamically based on market conditions.\n- Isolating agents to prevent failures from affecting other bots.\n\n**Solution:** The company used Docker Swarm to deploy multiple agent containers across different servers. Load balancing ensured optimal performance, while Kubernetes autoscaling allowed agents to increase or decrease based on trading volume.\n\n**Results:**\n\n✔️ 40% improvement in execution speed.\n\n✔️ Reduced infrastructure costs by 30%.\n\n✔️ Improved reliability, with zero downtime in peak trading hours.\n\n**_Real-World Case Study: AI Agents in Healthcare_**\n\n**Use Case: AI-Powered Disease Diagnosis**\n\nA hospital integrated AI agents to assist doctors in diagnosing diseases by analyzing medical images. Challenges included:\n\n- Ensuring real-time analysis of patient data.\n- Deploying AI models efficiently across hospital servers.\n- Maintaining data security while enabling remote diagnosis.\n\n**Solution:** By using Docker and Kubernetes, the hospital deployed AI-powered diagnostic agents across multiple locations, ensuring seamless updates and improved efficiency.\n\nResults:\n\n✔️ 30% faster diagnosis, reducing wait times.\n\n✔️ Enhanced accessibility for remote healthcare.\n\n✔️ Lower operational costs, increasing efficiency.\n\n**_Setting Up an AI Agent in Docker_**\n\nLet’s start by containerizing a simple AI agent. For this example, we’ll use an LLM-powered assistant based on Python and OpenAI’s API.\n\n**Step 1: Create a Dockerfile**\n\n```\n# Use a lightweight Python image\nFROM python:3.10-slim\n\n# Set the working directory\nWORKDIR /app\n\n# Copy the project files\nCOPY requirements.txt .\n\n# Install dependencies\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n\n# Copy the source code\nCOPY . .\n\n# Expose the port (if running an API)\nEXPOSE 8000\n\n# Define the command to run the AI agent\nCMD [\"python\", \"agent.py\"]\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\n**Step 2: Build and Run the Container**\n\n```\ndocker build -t ai-agent .\ndocker run -d --name my_ai_agent -p 8000:8000 ai-agent\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nThis creates an isolated AI agent that can run anywhere with zero configuration hassles.\n\n**Running Multi-Agent Systems with Docker Compose**\n\nIn real-world applications, AI agents often interact with databases, APIs, or other services. Docker Compose simplifies managing multi-container AI setups.\n\n**Example Docker Compose for Multi-Agent System**\n\n```\nversion: '3.8'\n\nservices:\n agent1:\n build: ./agent1\n ports:\n - \"8001:8000\"\n environment:\n - API_KEY=your_openai_key\n\n agent2:\n build: ./agent2\n ports:\n - \"8002:8000\"\n environment:\n - API_KEY=your_openai_key\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nDeploying multiple AI agents is now as simple as:\n\n`docker-compose up -d\n`\n\nThis approach enables seamless communication between AI agents while keeping them containerized.\n\n**Scaling AI Agents with Docker Swarm & Kubernetes**\n\nAs AI agent demand increases, a single machine might not be enough. Docker Swarm and Kubernetes help deploy AI agents across multiple servers.\n\n**Scaling with Docker Swarm**\n\n```\ndocker swarm init # Initialize the swarm\n\ndocker service create --name ai-agent \\\n --replicas 5 \\\n -p 8000:8000 \\\n ai-agent\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nThis command runs 5 instances of the AI agent across multiple nodes, ensuring high availability.\n\n**Scaling with Kubernetes**\n\nFor larger deployments, Kubernetes provides autoscaling and fault tolerance.\n\n**Deployment YAML for Kubernetes**\n\n```\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n name: ai-agent-deployment\nspec:\n replicas: 3\n selector:\n matchLabels:\n app: ai-agent\n template:\n metadata:\n labels:\n app: ai-agent\n spec:\n containers:\n - name: ai-agent\n image: ai-agent\n ports:\n - containerPort: 8000\n\n```\n\nEnter fullscreen modeExit fullscreen mode\n\nDeploy with:\n\n`kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`\n\nKubernetes will automatically distribute AI agents across available nodes.\n\n**Call to Action: Join the Community!**\n\nAI and Docker are shaping the future together.

    "text": "As AI systems that learn by mimicking the mechanisms of the human brain continue to advance, we're witnessing an evolution in models from rote regurgitation to genuine reasoning. This capability marks a new chapter in the evolution of AI—and what enterprises can gain from it. But in order to tap into this enormous potential, organizations will need to ensure they have the right infrastructure and computational resources to support the advancing technology. The reasoning revolution \"Reasoning models are qualitatively different than earlier LLMs,\" says Prabhat Ram, partner AI/HPC architect at Microsoft, noting that these models can explore different hypotheses, assess if answers are consistently correct, and adjust their approach accordingly. \"They essentially create an internal representation of a decision tree based on the training data they've been exposed to, and explore which solution might be the best.\" \n This adaptive approach to problem-solving isn’t without trade-offs. Earlier LLMs delivered outputs in milliseconds based on statistical pattern-matching and probabilistic analysis. This was—and still is—efficient for many applications, but it doesn’t allow the AI sufficient time to thoroughly evaluate multiple solution paths. In newer models, extended computation time during inference—seconds, minutes, or even longer—allows the AI to employ more sophisticated internal reinforcement learning. This opens the door for multi-step problem-solving and more nuanced decision-making. \n To illustrate future use cases for reasoning-capable AI, Ram offers the example of a NASA rover sent to explore the surface of Mars. \"Decisions need to be made at every moment around which path to take, what to explore, and there has to be a risk-reward trade-off. The AI has to be able to assess, 'Am I about to jump off a cliff? Or, if I study this rock and I have a limited amount of time and budget, is this really the one that's scientifically more worthwhile?'\" Making these assessments successfully could result in groundbreaking scientific discoveries at previously unthinkable speed and scale. Reasoning capabilities are also a milestone in the proliferation of agentic AI systems: autonomous applications that perform tasks on behalf of users, such as scheduling appointments or booking travel itineraries. \"Whether you're asking AI to make a reservation, provide a literature summary, fold a towel, or pick up a piece of rock, it needs to first be able to understand the environment—what we call perception—comprehend the instructions and then move into a planning and decision-making phase,\" Ram explains. Enterprise applications of reasoning-capable AI systems The enterprise applications for reasoning-capable AI are far-reaching. In health care, reasoning AI systems could analyze patient data, medical literature, and treatment protocols to support diagnostic or treatment decisions. In scientific research, reasoning models could formulate hypotheses, design experimental protocols, and interpret complex results—potentially accelerating discoveries across fields from materials science to pharmaceuticals. In financial analysis, reasoning AI could help evaluate investment opportunities or market expansion strategies, as well as develop risk profiles or economic forecasts. Armed with these insights, their own experience, and emotional intelligence, human doctors, researchers, and financial analysts could make more informed decisions, faster. But before setting these systems loose in the wild, safeguards and governance frameworks will need to be ironclad, particularly in high-stakes contexts like health care or autonomous vehicles. \"For a self-driving car, there are real-time decisions that need to be made vis-a-vis whether it turns the steering wheel to the left or the right, whether it hits the gas pedal or the brake—you absolutely do not want to hit a pedestrian or get into an accident,\" says Ram. \"Being able to reason through situations and make an ‘optimal’ decision is something that reasoning models will have to do going forward.\" The infrastructure underpinning AI reasoning To operate optimally, reasoning models require significantly more computational resources for inference. This creates distinct scaling challenges. Specifically, because the inference durations of reasoning models can vary widely—from just a few seconds to many minutes—load balancing across these diverse tasks can be challenging. Overcoming these hurdles requires tight collaboration between infrastructure providers and hardware manufacturers, says Ram, speaking of Microsoft’s collaboration with NVIDIA, which brings its accelerated computing platform to Microsoft products, including Azure AI. \"When we think about Azure, and when we think about deploying systems for AI training and inference, we really have to think about the entire system as a whole,\" Ram explains. \"What are you going to do differently in the data center? What are you going to do about multiple data centers? How are you going to connect them?\" These considerations extend into reliability challenges at all scales: from memory errors at the silicon level, to transmission errors within and across servers, thermal anomalies, and even data center-level issues like power fluctuations—all of which require sophisticated monitoring and rapid response systems. \n By creating a holistic system architecture designed to handle fluctuating AI demands, Microsoft and NVIDIA’s collaboration allows companies to harness the power of reasoning models without needing to manage the underlying complexity. In addition to performance benefits, these types of collaborations allow companies to keep pace with a tech landscape evolving at breakneck speed. \"Velocity is a unique challenge in this space,\" says Ram. \"Every three months, there is a new foundation model. The hardware is also evolving very fast—in the last four years, we've deployed each generation of NVIDIA GPUs and now NVIDIA GB200NVL72. Leading the field really does require a very close collaboration between Microsoft and NVIDIA to share roadmaps, timelines, and designs on the hardware engineering side, qualifications and validation suites, issues that arise in production, and so on.\" Advancements in AI infrastructure designed specifically for reasoning and agentic models are critical for bringing reasoning-capable AI to a broader range of organizations. Without robust, accessible infrastructure, the benefits of reasoning models will remain relegated to companies with massive computing resources. Looking ahead, the evolution of reasoning-capable AI systems and the infrastructure that supports them promises even greater gains. For Ram, the frontier extends beyond enterprise applications to scientific discovery and breakthroughs that propel humanity forward: \"The day when these agentic systems can power scientific research and propose new hypotheses that can lead to a Nobel Prize, I think that's the day when we can say that this evolution is complete.” To learn more, please read Microsoft and NVIDIA accelerate AI development and performance, watch the NVIDIA GTC AI Conference sessions on demand, and explore the topic areas of Azure AI solutions and Azure AI infrastructure.
