1. Domain Focus: Are you interested in a specific application area (e.g., robotics, healthcare, customer service) or general advancements in AI agents?
2. Timeframe: How recent? The last 6 months, 1 year, or a broader period?
3. Technical Depth: Do you want high-level summaries (e.g., "AI agents can now do X") or detailed technical insights (e.g., architectures like Mixture of Experts)?
4. Type of Breakthrough: Are you looking for improvements in capabilities (e.g., planning, tool use), scalability, or real-world deployments?

If you'd prefer not to specify, I'll assume a general scenarioâ€”covering notable advances in the past year across capabilities like multi-agent collaboration, memory/context handling, and real-world integration.`;
